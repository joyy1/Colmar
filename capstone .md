# Colmar
student project
for Codcademy.

This project is the last project for my HTML class. I am very glad I decided to take the class. I love to do all these projects, 
thought they always take me huge amount of time. but I finally had some progress about applying the concepts i learned from class 
to the real practice. I watched some video and read some articles, it makes me realize, i only touch the little chip of the whole
industry. there always a lot of to learn. and I wish i could become an expert on this one day in the future.

For this project,
I choose the warm color for the background design. The purpose is to make student feel warm and bright welcome. and Dark letters 
emphasize the clarity of design style. 
Beige color and nutral bacground in the middle section to make slightly variation of the reading experience. Transform the warm
and vivid welcome begining section into a slightly deeper academic and career tones.
I couldnt make my mobile version css work for the html. So I made another repository for the mobil version. Named as colmobile.
Thanks for reading and giving me suggestions, it would advance me for my HTML practice.
